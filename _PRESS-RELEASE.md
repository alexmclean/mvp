There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  QuickSport: The easiest and most efficient way to organize and manage sports teams!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Intramural captains and motivated organizers have to struggle with keeping track of teams and players, but my app
  will do all of the legwork for them.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  QuickSport will help team captains sign up teams, add team members, and communicate with their teammates about
  logistics for their upcoming games.  Maybe Josh hasn't paid you his registration fee for your recreational league basketball team?
  Maybe Sam can't make it to dodgeball on Wednesday night and you need to replace him?  Organizing anything from a 
  team party to a change of location for your next game is organized in one place to make running a team as easy as possible.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Those of us who have ever been intramural or recreational league captains for a team know that organizing people is difficult.
  Conflicts come up in people's lives that prevent them from showing up, plans get changed last minute, people forget to pay 
  or bring equipment; the point is: logistics are a pain in the ass.  QuickSport aims to organize all of the actions
  you might need to take as captain in one place and optimize the user experience of maintaining a team.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  By creating a team and signing up your players, you are placing them in an easy to use communication system
  that allows you to remind them about whatever issues the team has.  Ideally, we want to connect you through facebook
  and allow you to communicate either publically with your whole team, or privately with one member if the issue does not
  concern everyone.  

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "We're bringing amateur sports closer together, one team at a time."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  All you need to do to get started is log in with Facebook, and click "Create a Team."  This will immediately give you access to all the features required to run your team efficiently and add new members.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "My bike polo team was in disarray after our star striker broke his leg, but I was able to rally everyone using QuickSport!"
  - Some Guy

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
